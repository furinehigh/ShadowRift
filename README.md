# Shadow Rift
A 2D fighting game which uses dual realm concept and shadow fighting, and with multiplayer compatibility and easy controls.

# Why build this?
I'm developing this game to improve my game dev as well as backend skills, I have played many games like these and always wanted to create a good fighting game with proper animations and multiplayer capabilities + want some Milkyway coins too :)

# Tech stack
- Next.TS
- Phaser to use 2D model with bones and animations
- DragonBones for animations
- Canva for theme designing
- Redis and MongoDB for game server

# Features


# Upcomming features or changes


# AI usage
AI usage is negligible and limited to the bugs fixes(frustrating ones :), I haven't used any kind of copilots either.
