# Guide to Shadow Rift: Deal Realm Combat game
If u wanna play this game, then please go through this guide to get the best knowledge about the game.
Note: This game is currently not fully responsive, so try to play it on large devices.

# Default controls (PC or with keyboard)
- `w` or `←` to move left
- `d` or `→` to move right
- `↑` or `space` to jump
- `z` to punch
- `x` to kick
- `r` to toggle the RIFT realm (there is a cooldown of 5 seconds :)
- `esc` or escape key to pause/resume the game

For **Mobile Players** the controls are on screen and can be changed from the controls settings.

NOTE: the climbing by the players are done automatically if they are pretty close to the ledge while jumping and all these controls are *custom* and can be changed from the **Controls** settings.

# Realm
**Normal Realm** is the default realm/space where the player spawns and fights when game starts, but they can switch to **Rift Realm** by pressing the default button `r`. The whole purpose of the dual relm is that players can save themselves + future updates will make the rift realm more unstable and very random.
Enemies HP isn't visible if they are in Rift realm..

Note: When switching realm make sure u are on a high ground or jumping bcoz the moment u hit realm switch button your character will be spawned in the other realm at the same point which might cause your player be spawned inside a building and then it will fall... death :( - give it a try...

# HUD
The game has basic HUD(Heads Up Display) for now including the players health bar and relm switch cooldown timer. All the enemies have their own health bar displayed on top of their heads when they are being damaged.

# Training Mode
In this mode you have to fight all the random enemies the game will throw at you and try not to die, the more you kill the more enemies gets spawned after each **Wave**. There is no ending for this..
## Types of enemies
- Grunt - these are the lowest rank enemies with low attack power and score.
- Elite - these are decent enemies with decent attack power.
- Boss - these are the highest rank enemies in the training mode and have attack power equivalent to the players + gives u more score when killed.
